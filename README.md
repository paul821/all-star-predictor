MLB All Star predictor

final -> final copy -> allstar_fin

I could obviously go in a lot deeper but I would need better data to do so.

Is the all star game a popularity contest? This was the question that started everything.

This took me on an ML learning journey. What was initially a multivariable classification project turned into:

- utilizing multiple classification algorithms
- hyperparameter optimization
- shapley plots
- feature importance

Enjoy.
